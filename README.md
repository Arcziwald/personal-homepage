<h2>My Personal Homepage </h1>
 My name is Artur and I am a fascinated Frontend Developer who constantly strives to improve his skills. My heart beats for creating not only beautiful, but above all functional interfaces that set new standards in the world of digital aesthetics.

My journey in the world of code began with my fascination with the possibilities offered by creating interactions between people and machines. I am constantly learning new technologies and tools to stay up to date with the dynamically changing landscape of Frontend Development.

In my portfolio you will find not only projects, but the history of my development. Recent projects I've worked on are not just lines of code, but stories about challenges, creativity and teamwork. For me, each project is a chance to go beyond the rules and create something unique.

If you are interested in cooperation or would like to learn more, feel free to contact me. I am happy to share my experiences and ideas for the future.

Together, we can turn visions into reality, coding it piece by piece.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
